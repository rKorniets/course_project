# Audio Denoising Web Application

This is a web application that utilizes deep learning Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) to remove noise from audio files. The application allows users to upload their noisy audio files, waits for the processing to finish, and then provides the option to compare the processed audio files. Additionally, users can explore the functionality of the application by uploading their own audio file as an example, where some pre-defined noise will be added to demonstrate the denoising process.

## Features

- Upload your noisy audio file

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/audio-denoising-web-app.git
2. Install the required dependencies:

    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt

## Usage
1. Run the application:
    ```bash
    python main.py

2. Access the web application in your browser:
    ```bash
    http://localhost:5000

3. Upload your noisy audio file, wait for the denoising process to complete, and download the processed audio file.

4. Optionally, try the application using your own audio file by uploading it as an example, where some pre-defined noise will be added to demonstrate the denoising process.
